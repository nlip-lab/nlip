summary: "In our experiments, we show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques by 2.74% weighted F1 score on average on two standard public datasets in the area of disaster management. We also report experimental results for granular actionable multilabel classification datasets in disaster domain for the first time, on which we outperform BERT by 3.00% on average w.r.t. weighted F1."
