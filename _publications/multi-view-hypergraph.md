summary: "We propose a Multi-view Hypergraph Convolution Network (Multi-HGCN) where we learn POI representations by considering multiple hypergraphs across multiple views of the data. We build a comprehensive model to learn the POI representation capturing temporal, spatial and trajectory-based patterns among POIs by employing hypergraphs. We use hypergraph convolution to learn better POI representation by using spectral properties of hypergraph. Experiments conducted on three real-world datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches."
