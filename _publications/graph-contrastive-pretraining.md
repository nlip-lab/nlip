summary: "In this paper, we propose a novel way to effectively utilize labeled data from related tasks with a graph based supervised contrastive learning approach. We formulate a token-graph by extrapolating the supervised information from examples to tokens. Our experiments with 8 disaster datasets show our method outperforms baselines and also example-level contrastive learning based formulation."
