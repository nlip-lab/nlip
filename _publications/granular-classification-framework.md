summary: "We propose a semi-supervised learning framework which utilizes abundantly available unlabelled data by self-learning. The proposed framework improves the performance of the classifier for resource-constrained classes by selectively incorporating highly confident samples from unlabelled data for self-learning. Incremental incorporation of unlabelled data, as and when they become available, is suitable for ongoing disaster mitigation."
