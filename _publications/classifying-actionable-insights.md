summary: "We focus on the problem of automated classification of disaster related tweets to a set of predefined categories. Some example categories considered are resource availability, resource requirement, infrastructure damage etc. Proper annotation of the tweets with these class information can help in timely determination of the steps needed to be taken to address the concerns of the people in the affected areas. Depending on the information category, different feature sets might be useful for proper identification of posts belonging to that category."
