summary: "We propose a supervised feature construction method to classify tweets, based on the actionable information that might be present, posted during different disaster scenarios. Improved classifier performance for such classification tasks can be helpful in the rescue and relief operations. We used three benchmark datasets containing tweets posted during Nepal and Italy earthquakes in 2015 and 2016 respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed method obtains better classification performance on these benchmark datasets."
