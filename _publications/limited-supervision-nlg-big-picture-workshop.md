summary: "We present a research narrative aimed at enabling language technology for multiple natural language generation (NLG) tasks in low-resource languages (LRLs). With approximately 7,000 languages spoken globally, many lack the resources required for model training. NLG applications for LRLs present two additional key challenges: (i) The training is more pronounced, and (ii) Zero-shot modeling is a viable research direction for scalability; however, generating zero-shot well-formed text in target LRLs is challenging. Addressing these concerns, this narrative introduces three promising research explorations that serve as a step toward enabling language technology for many LRLs. These approaches make effective use of transfer learning and limited supervision techniques for modeling. Evaluations were conducted mostly in the zero-shot setting, enabling scalability. This research narrative is an ongoing doctoral thesis."
