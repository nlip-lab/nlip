summary: "In this paper, we propose an approach that considers a comprehensive set of features including but not limited to text representation, tag based similarity as well as multiple user-based features that target users' availability, agility as well as expertise for predicting the best answerer for a given question. We also include features that give incentives to users who answer less but more important questions over those who answer a lot of questions of less importance."
