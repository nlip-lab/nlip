abstract = {Abstract Scientific documents generally contain multiple mathematical expressions in them. Detecting inline mathematical expressions are one of the most important and challenging tasks in scientific text mining. Recent works that detect inline mathematical expressions in scientific documents have looked at the problem from an image processing perspective. There is little work that has targeted the problem from NLP perspective. Towards this, we define a few features and applied Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to detect inline mathematical expressions in scientific documents. Apart from this feature based approach, we also propose a hybrid algorithm that combines Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory networks (Bi-LSTM) and feature-based approach for this task. Experimental results suggest that this proposed hybrid method outperforms several baselines in the literature and also individual methods in the hybrid approach.},
